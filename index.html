          <h6>by <em>Days for Girls International</em></h6>
          <p>Girls are quite often sequestered in cattle sheds or small huts in the remote highlands of western Nepal during their periods, as part of a cultural practice known as Chhaupadi. Girls are not only embarrassed by menstruation, but they
            are also frequently exposed to genuine risk, such as harsh weather, smoke inhalation, and attacks. The charge is being led by a local training squad of Nepali girls and women to stop this malpractice for good.</p>

            willingness to attend school on a regular basis, and they finally drop out. ECCA will assist schools by providing educational materials that will motivate children to study harder and stay in school.</p>
